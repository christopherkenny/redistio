`redistio` provides a point-and-click districting interface powered by [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). For regular `sf` objects, it can be used to draw districts and export assignment files. For `redist_map` objects, algorithmic assistance is enabled for map drawing.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `redistio` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
pak::pkg_install('christopherkenny/redistio')
```

## Example

The most basic application of `redistio` starts with an `sf` tibble and a column of district assignments.

```r
library(redistio)

draw(dc, dc$ward)
```
