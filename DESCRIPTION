Description: A point and click editor for districts built on 'shiny' and 'Leaflet'. 
    Users can draw districts and calculate standard redistricting metrics, like 
    compactness or the number of administrative splits. Maps can be exported as
    assignment files or shapefiles, readable by most other redistricting software.
